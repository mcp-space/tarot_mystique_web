# Placeholder for tarot card images
# This file serves as a placeholder until actual tarot card images are added
# Images should be placed in this directory with the naming convention:
# 00-fool.jpg, 01-magician.jpg, etc.

# For now, you can use any placeholder image service or create simple card designs
# Recommended image size: 300x500 pixels
# Format: JPG or PNG

# Example sources for tarot images:
# - Create your own artistic interpretations
# - Use public domain tarot decks
# - Commission custom artwork
# - Use placeholder image services temporarily

# Note: This is a placeholder file that will be replaced with actual images
